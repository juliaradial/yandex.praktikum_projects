I built a sales funnel, researched the users' journey to purchase. Analyzed the results of the A/B test for the introduction of new fonts. I compared 2 control groups with each other, made sure that the traffic was divided correctly, and then compared it with the test group. It was revealed that the new font will not significantly affect user behavior. | A/B test, visualization, statistical test |

I installed PostgreSQL, deployed the database. Then I wrote a pipeline script that allowed me to collect data for a certain time period, and configured its offline operation via crontab. To visualize the collected data, I wrote a dashboard script with multiple filters and also ran it on a remote machine. Based on the results, a presentation was prepared with the obtained graphs. | dashboard, pipeline, Yandex.Cloud, remote server, virtual machine, cron |

Then I фnalyzed the results of the A/B test, plotted cumulative revenue, average receipt, conversions by groups, and then calculated the statistical significance of differences in conversions and average receipts based on raw and purified data. Based on the analysis, I made a decision about the inexpediency of further testing. | A/B test, statistical test, framework, RICE, ICE |

I predicted the probability of outflow (at the level of the next month) for each client; I formed typical portraits of users: the brightest groups were highlighted, their main properties were characterized; the main signs that most strongly affect outflow were analyzed. | KMeans, Machine Learning, dendrogram, RandomForestClassifier, LogisticRegression |
